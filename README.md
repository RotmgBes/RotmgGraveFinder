RotmgGraveFinder
================

Builds a link that can be used to view grave yard data in the Flash game, RotMG. Also I have added 3 buttons which link you to the leader boards. Shows a little more then realm eye currently does with graves.

How to use:
If you are trying to view your own accounts graves, you need your account id number. To find it, you need to use a web tool that lets you see sorce code, and go on realm and hit the grave yard tab by character selecet. If you want to see the grave yards of people on the leader boreds then click one of the three buttons on the bottom. After clicking one, you can see the account Id's of all players on the leader borad you clicked.
